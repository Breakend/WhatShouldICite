# WhatShouldICite
This is an informal record of original citations that I'm aware of for key terms in scientific literature. It started because I didn't know what's the original work to cite for eligibility traces and it seems important to do proper credit assignment.

## Eligibility traces

Based on stimulus traces by Hull and memory traces by Klopf, the earliest work that I could find on this is that of Sutton and Barto. Probably best to cite Klopf, Sutton, and Barto.

## REINFORCE

}
```

## Policy gradient

This is REINFORCE with value functions, if using purely Monte carlo, should probably cite REINFORCE (should probably cite all three for policy gradient anyways?).
